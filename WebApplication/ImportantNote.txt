Dev Setup:
-----------
Install Nodejs and npm
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install Angular CLI:
--------------------
npm install -g @angular/cli

The contents of node_modules is not meant to be committed to source control. The idea behind npm is that it tracks all required node dependencies in a file called package.json. This file should be committed to source control. Then on a different machine, you can check out the code and run

npm install

This looks at the package.json file and downloads all required files from the cloud and puts them all into a new node_modules directory.

To build, deploy and open the app locally:
-------------------------------------------

ng server --open
